# Resource file format

The resource file contains resource entries all of which start with a Resource
Entry Header and are followed by the associated data.

Most resource entry data is compressed with the LZS (STAC) data compression
algorithm. It seems that the Compression Method can be ignore. When the data
is compressed it is always compressed using LZS. If it is compressed can be
checked by comparing Compressed Size with Uncompressed Size. When they
are the same the data is uncompressed.

0x0003  UInt32  Compressed Size;
